The code has a function that doubles a number and shows the result.
It asks the user to enter a number.
The code keeps the number entered in a variable called "num".
The code uses the "double_amount" function with "num" as input.
The function multiplies "num" by 2 and saves it to "double".
It then displays "double" using a message.
Finally, the function gives back the value of "double".
To make the code better, the "print" in the function should return the result.
The name "double" can be changed to something more descriptive.
The variable name "twice_num" could be more descriptive.
